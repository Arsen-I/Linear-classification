Classification on Wine Dataset
Dataset description
We will be working with a dataset on wines from the UCI machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine ). It contains data for 178 instances. The dataset is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The features in the dataset are:
1. Alcohol
2. Malic acid
3. Ash
4. Alcalinity of ash
5. Magnesium
6. Total phenols
7. Flavanoids
8. Nonflavanoid phenols
9. Proanthocyanins
10. Color intensity
11. Hue
12. OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13. Proline
